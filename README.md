# Overview
This project is a implementation of the Connect Four game(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

Players ("X" or "O") put their pieces in a board and whoever connects four pieces in a row wins. Different from a tic tac toe game, the board has 6 rows x 7 columns, and players can only put a piece to the top of a given column.  The piece will then fall to the lowest, unoccupied space in that column.

# What I have learned
1. More coding practice with Python.
2. Separate different functions to achieve decoupling and modularization.
3. Write test cases for the program.
